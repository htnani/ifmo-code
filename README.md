# ITMO University
### Computer Technologies Chair / Information Technologies and Programming Faculty / Internet Technologies and Programming MegaFaculty

Completely all source code, written by me while at ITMO University, except some project's sources.  
It's not an "open-source project", that means code style sometimes leaves a lot to be desired, but I did my best.

### For ITMO students

If you're here for my code of labs/homework: [NO GOD!](https://youtu.be/umDr0mPuyQc) PLEASE NO! [NOOOOO!!!](https://youtu.be/Eal4fep7pK4)  
Do not copy-paste! Review it and write your own! It's better for you.  
Thanks.
